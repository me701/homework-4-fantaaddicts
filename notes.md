# Project Notes

## Assumptions

1. Heat transfer through aluminum can is negligible.
2. While liquid stiring, forced covnection is added.
3. Throughout the entire process conduciton is taking place.
4. 1D problem because infinite cylinder height.

## Paramters
Cylindical Can  
Diameter = 6 cm  
Height = 12 cm  

### Temperatures
$T_{hot car}$ = 95 F  
$T_{\infty}$ = 32 F  
$T_{beverage}$ = 45 F  

### Time of rotation
30 seconds, 5 min break, 30 seconds, 5 min break, 30 seconds
