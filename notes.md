# Project Notes

## Assumptions

1. Heat transfer through aluminum can is negligible.
2. While liquid stiring, forced covnection is added.
3. Throughout the entire process conduciton is taking place.
4. 1D problem because infinite cylinder height.
5. No heat generation.
6. Consistent volume and surface area.
7. Constant density for the water.
8. Temperature gradients within the can negligible and lumped capacitance method used for conduction.

## Paramters
Cylindical Can  
Diameter = 6 cm  
Height = 12 cm  

### Temperatures
$T_{hot car}$ = 95 F  
$T_{\infty}$ = 32 F  
$T_{beverage}$ = 45 F  

### Time of rotation
30 seconds, 5 min break, 30 seconds, 5 min break, 30 seconds

### Needs
Uncertainty quantification
Unit tests
Refine internal modeling assumption
